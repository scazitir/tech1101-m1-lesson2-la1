            <p>
                I'm from Brazil and moved to Calgary on August 4. I can speak Brazilian-Portuguese and English as well.
                <br>I live with my wife and our four cats, and in my free time, I love to go outside to walk or ride my bike, to know some places, and discover good things to do in Calgary.
